This repository is used to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration from Landsat-8 OLI.

Details for the training and validatioin of model can be found: Cao et al., (2020), A machine learning approach to estimate chlorophyll-a from Landsat-8 measurements in inland lakes, Remote sensing of environment, Acceppted.

Model trained by the xgboost model has been uploaded, however relevant scripts are in tuning for a better use. We will update it in time once the tuning finishes.


Please let me know if you have any concerns.
