# chlorophyll-a estimates from Landsat-8 measurments

### About
This repository contains source code for the following papers:

- <i>["Cao et al., (2020), A machine learning approach to estimate chlorophyll-a from Landsat-8 measurements in inland lakes, Remote sensing of environment, Volume 248, 111974. 10.1016/j.rse.2020.111974.</i>
<br>

This repository is used to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration from Landsat-8 OLI.

Details for the training and validatioin of model can be found: doi: 

Current performance is shown in the following scatter plots, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. Note that the models supplied in this repository are trained using 100% of the dataset for a potential improvement in other regions, and so observed performance may differ slightly.
