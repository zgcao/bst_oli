This repository is used to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration from Landsat-8 OLI.

Details for the training and validatioin of model can be found: Cao et al., (2020), A machine learning approach to estimate chlorophyll-a from Landsat-8 measurements in inland lakes, Remote sensing of environment, Volume 248, 111974.doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2020.111974.

Current performance is shown in the following scatter plots, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. Note that the models supplied in this repository are trained using 100% of the dataset for a potential improvement in other regions, and so observed performance may differ slightly.


Please let me know if you have any concerns.
