# Lake chlorophyll-a estimates from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI measurments in Lake Taihu

The model and scripts would be avaiable soon!

### About
This repository contains source code for the following papers:

- <i>["Cao et al., (2021), Landsat observations of chlorophyll-a variations in Lake Taihu from 1984 to 2019, JAG, underreview"]</i>

### Usage
This repository is used to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentration from Landsat Rayleigh-corrected reflectance, which can be produced by SeaDAS.

### Description for this algorithm
**Models supplied in this repository are trained using 100% of the dataset** for a potential improvement in other regions, and so observed performance may differ slightly.
